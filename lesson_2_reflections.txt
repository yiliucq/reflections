1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
YL: git init creates a metadata file .git for tracking history of the repository but without git add the files are untracked. git add creats a staging area for files you are ready to commit. git status shows the current status of the repository.

2. How is the stating area different from the working directory and the repository? what value do you think it offers?
YL: to keep the changes to be committed logical and small.
